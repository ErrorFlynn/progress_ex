			<h1>Extended progress widget</h1>
			<p>
				<code>progress_ex</code> is a simple extension of the <code>nana::progress</code> class, adding text to the widget and a few color 
                presets. It modifies none of the existing behavior of the base class, and is constructed and used in exactly the same way. By 
                default, the widget looks no different than a regular <code>nana::progress</code> widget.

			<h1>Text modes</h1>
			<p>
				The text that the widget displays depends on which text mode the widget is using. You can change the text mode by calling 
				<code>progress_ex::text_mode()</code> with one of the following arguments:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>progress_ex::text_modes::percentage</code>
					<p>
						Displays what percentage <code>progress::value()</code> is out of <code>progress::amount()</code>. Only works if the progress 
						widget is not in "unknown" mode.
					</p>
                </li>
				<li>
					<code>progress_ex::text_modes::value</code>
					<p>
						Displays <code>progress::value()</code> out of <code>progress::amount()</code>. This is useful to indicate overall progress 
						when a list of items is being processed, for example. Only works if the progress widget is not in "unknown" mode.
					</p>
                </li>
				<li>
					<code>progress_ex::text_modes::caption</code>
					<p>
						Displays the text that you set by calling <code>progress_ex::caption()</code>. This also works if the progress widget is in 
						"unknown" mode, but without text contrast (see below). Note that this is the default text mode, and doesn't need to be set 
						explicitly unless switching to it from a different text mode.
					</p>
                </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you want the widget to stop displaying text, just set the text mode to <code>caption</code> and set the caption to an 
                empty string.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>Text contrast</h1>
			<p>
				By default, the text intersecting with the "full" part of the widget (the progress bar) is displayed with one color, and the 
                text intersecting with the "empty" part (the background) is displayed with a different color. Each of these two colors is 
                meant to contrast with the part of the widget that they intesect with, to improve legibility. They can be changed by calling 
                <code>void text_contrast_colors(nana::color full, nana::color empty)</code>.
            </p>
			<p>
				If this behavior is not desired, you can disable it by calling <code>void text_contrast(bool enable)</code> with a 
                <code>false</code> argument. The regular, "no contrast" text color can be changed by calling 
                <code>void text_color(nana::color)</code>.
            </p>

			<h1>Color presets for the progress bar</h1>
			<p>
                As you probably know, <code>nana::progress</code> allows you to change the progress bar and background colors using the 
                widget scheme. In addition to that, <code>progress_ex</code> provides a few color presets that you can apply by calling 
                <code>color_preset(color_presets preset, double shade = 0)</code>.
            </p>
			<p>
                The first argument can be any of the <code>progress_ex::color_presets</code> enumerated values, which are: 
                <code>{ nana, blue, green, orange, violet, brown }</code>.
            </p>
			<p>
                The second argument modifies the shade of the colors, and should be in the range of -1.0 to 1.0, although effective values 
                are probably from -0.4 to 0.4. Negative values produce darker shades, zero means no change, and positive values produce 
                lighter shades.
